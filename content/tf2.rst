:summary: Some reflections on TF2

The Beginning
=============

I started playing Team Fortress 2 (TF2) a month after the pyro update.
I recall enjoying pyro and engie, especially when playing with a few
friends over voicechat. When I played alone I started to gravitate
toward arena mode. It's short rounds and frequent team balances were
more enjoyable then being crushed on a payload or capture point map.

There was one server I tended to frequent where another regular
frequently raged and most of the other players bantered. It was
especially satisfying to beat out several of the players that were very
good. Otherwise I mostly went from server to server messing around.

I played for a few months before switching to something else (I think a
friend convinced me to play World of Warcraft for a short time) before
coming back. I had forgotten where I had enjoyed playing and I struggled
to remember the server name.
