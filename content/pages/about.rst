About
#####

I'm Mark McGuire (aka TronPaul). I'm a software developer who's day job
currently involves clojure, java, puppet, and other languages from time
to time. In my spare time I work on my own projects, play videogames on
my PC, read science fiction and fantasy, and listen to music.

  the Cloudformation template for my servers in AWS.

Favorite Games
==============

Team Fortress 2
  My number one FPS. I play this competitively in UGC_'s Highlander
  league. I've played in the Steel, Silver, and Gold division as Scout
  and Sniper and I hope to play in Platinum some day.

Counter Strike: Global Offensive
  The FPS I wish I was good at. I call this game the "thinking man's
  shooter". DM (deathmatch skill) will only get you so far. You need
  to know when to play aggressively and passively, grenade locations,
  rotations and many other things. The pace of matches is very tight
  and a close game is very easy to be caught up in.

Favorite Books
==============

Cryptonomicon [Neal Stephenson]
  Stephenson's writing style is my favorite to read. It was confusing
  at first, but I feel that he captures the thought patterns of his
  characters well. The three threads of the story come together in an
  almost crack-fic like manner.

Pandora's Star, Judas Unchained [Peter F Hamilton]
  The number of characters is daunting, but the way the story comes
  together in the end is wonderful. The world Hamilton envisions in
  this series contains very interesting takes on a distant future
  including immortality, criminal sentences, and other things that
  flesh out his universe.
